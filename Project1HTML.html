        <p>Beyond creating simple text and images in your website, HTML can be used to create headings of various sizes, create basic styles, arrange images and text within the webpage, and link different websites with hyperlinks. The various heading sizes can be used to show varying levels of importance within the website's content. HTML can create basic styles that make your website appear less dull. Arranging images and text within the website can be useful to ensure less space is consumed, to show relationships between images and paragraphs, and to make your website more neat. Finally, hyperlinks can link unrelated websites and help you to show your sources, or to credit certain sites so you aren't accused of plagerism. Overall, HTML creates the website that you see and learn from.</p>
